In this Java example:

1- We represent the maze as a 2D array, where 0 represents an open path, and 1 represents a blocked path.

2- We use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with a stack to explore possible paths through the maze.

3- We start from the top-left corner of the maze and traverse through the maze while marking visited cells.

4-If we reach the bottom-right corner of the maze, we have found a path.

5- The isValid method checks if a given cell is within the bounds of the maze.

In the main method, we create a MazeSolver object and call the solveMaze method to find a path through the maze.

This code will either print "Path found!" if a path from the start to the goal exists or "No path found." if there is no valid path through the maze.
