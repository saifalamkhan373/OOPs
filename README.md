## Object-Oriented Programming

In Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm. It allows you to structure your code into classes and objects, promoting code reusability, modularity, and encapsulation. Let's go through the key OOP concepts in Java:

1. Classes and Objects:
   - A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It describes the properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that objects of that class will have.
   - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or concept in your program and can interact with other objects.

2. Encapsulation:
   - Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.
   - Access to the data and methods is controlled through access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, allowing you to enforce data protection and abstraction.

3. Inheritance:
   - Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (base classes or superclasses).
   - A subclass inherits the properties and methods of its superclass, allowing code reuse and the extension of functionality.
   - The `extends` keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes.

4. Polymorphism:
   - Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
   - It allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types, providing flexibility and extensibility.
   - Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) and method overloading (creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).

5. Abstraction:
   - Abstraction focuses on defining interfaces and abstract classes that provide common behaviors without specifying the implementation details.
   - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and serve as a foundation for creating concrete classes that inherit and implement their abstract behaviors.
   - Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to by implementing their methods. Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a single class.

6. Modularity:
   - Modularity is achieved by organizing code into separate classes and packages, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature.
   - Classes can be grouped into packages, which provide a way to organize and manage related classes and make them accessible or restricted as needed.

These OOP concepts in Java provide a powerful and flexible way to structure and develop applications. By following OOP principles, you can write clean, maintainable, and scalable code in Java.

7. SOLID PRINCIPLES: 
   -The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.
   These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.
  -> The Single Responsibility Principle
  -> The Open-Closed Principle
  -> The Liskov Substitution Principle
  -> The Interface Segregation Principle
  -> The Dependency Inversion Principle

7.1->  The Single Responsibility Principle: The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change". The class above violates the single responsibility principle.
